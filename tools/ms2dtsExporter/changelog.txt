==============================================================================

This file contains change information for the Torque DTS file exporter
for Milkshape v1.5.8

The original version of this code was written be José Luis Cebrián who
has graciously allowed us to integrate his code into the Torque SDK.
José did an awesome job of putting this tool together and the GG staff
is very gratefull for the work he's put in to it.

==============================================================================

- rjp: Moved dtsSDK from tools/ms2dtsExporter to lib/
- tg: Fixed duplicate DTS name strings
- tg: Fixed problem with sequences including incorrect bones.
- tg: Fixed incorrect sequence range display in dialog box
- tg: Fixed problem with rotations in multi-sequence animations
- tg: Added support for export options using named materials.
- tg: Added multi-sequence support using named materials.
- tg: The debug build DLL now includes the work debug in the name it exports to MS.
- tg: Added support for mesh flags. These are added to a mesh's name and are
      comma delimited after a colon, for example "name: flag1,flag2". Current
      flags are "Billboard", "BillboardZ", "ENormals"
- tg: Since MS doesn't allow you to shrink the grid below 1, I've changed the
      default scale to 0.1
- tg: Created a new project file for the Torque SDK workspace.
- tg: Now automatically selects any mesh called "Collision" as the collision mesh.
- tg: Fixed sequence "matters" arrays to export individually (was all the same)
- tg: The animation now only includes information for affected nodes.
- tg: Simplified bone-import code (now assumes parents exist before child)
- tg: Removed extra node creation, all meshes not attached to bones are assigned
      to the root node.
- tg: Changed axis orientation, Milkshape X,Y,Z = Torque -X,Z,Y
- tg: Added animation cyclic flag to export dialog box.
- tg: Fixed bounds, radius & tubeRadius to use node transforms
- tg: Got rid of unused node initialization (siblings, firstMesh, etc)
- tg: Fixed quaternion vertex rotation to be Torque compatible.
- tg: Re-organized bone/mesh management for better support of different
      mesh types. Initial version supports standalone rigid meshes, or
      rigid meshes attached to a bone.  For a rigid mesh to be associated
      with a bone, all it's vertices must be assigned to that bone.
- tg: Initial import of MilkShape exorter from José Luis Cebrián
