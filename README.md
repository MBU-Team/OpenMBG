# OpenMBG
A reverse engineered version of Marble Blast Gold based on Torque Game Engine 1.2

## Compiling
You require Visual Studio 2022 and CMake to build the game for windows.

## Differences
- Terrain and Water support has been added.
- Existing .recs from the original may desync due to floating point and mission load differences.
- FPS is unlocked by default.

## License
The MIT license only applies to the changes done to the original Torque Game Engine 1.2 source code that is not shared by the OpenMBU project.
