/// Telnet admin console.
///
/// Torque supports remote access to its console. This is most useful when
/// running a dedicated server, as you can remotely administer the game
/// (for instance, kicking people). In the context of a MMORPG, this sort of
/// functionality would be useful for managing a server.
///
/// There are a number of products for Tribes2 which allow remote administration
/// via a nice GUI.
///
/// @section telnetconsole_use Using the Telnet Console
///
/// The TelnetConsole is designed to be used globally, so you don't instantiate 
/// it like a normal class. Instead, you allow it to manage itself:
///
/// @code
///      // How to initialize the TelnetConsole.
///      TelnetConsole::create();
///
///      // How to shut down the TelnetConsole.
///      TelnetConsole::destroy();
/// @endcode
