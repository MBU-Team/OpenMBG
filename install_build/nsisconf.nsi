; this file sets the defaults that will be used
; this file is treated as if it is in the directory
; that you are building from. i.e. the command
; File whatever.dat
; would need whatever.dat to be in your build directory
; (not necessarily the same directory as this file)


; if you want to change the default icon or bitmaps, you can do it here.
;Icon "C:\program files\nsis\newicon.ico"
;EnabledBitmap "C:\program files\nsis\newenabled.bmp"
;DisabledBitmap "C:\program files\nsis\newdisabled.bmp"

; if you want to define symbols, whatever, you can do that to.
;!define poo


; Datablock optimizations can save size, and are fast now.
; SetDatablockOptimize off

;use one of these if you have upx or petite installed
;note that your exe packer should not pack the first icon :)
;and paths should ideally be absolute (since you could be 
;building your installer anywhere)

;!packhdr tmp.dat "C:\program files\upx\upx -9 -q tmp.dat"
;!packhdr tmp.dat "C:\program files\petite\petite -9 -b0 -r** -p0 -y tmp.dat"
